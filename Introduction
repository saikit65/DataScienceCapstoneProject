1. Introduction/Business Problem

A friend of mine is planning to immigrate to Toronto, Canada from Hong Kong with her family. She is with her husband and has two son and a dog. I'm trying to identify the characteristic of each neighbourhood, their most common venues nearby and their clustering similarity, and try to leverage the data science technique to evaluate the neighbourhood of Toronto, and recommend the best option for her to stay and start her new live.
